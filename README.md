# Running the application

Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. Make sure you have `node` installed. The exact version `v16.13.1` is what I used and recommend (I use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple node versions).
2. Open a terminal inside or navigate to the project directory - `cd lightsout-viget`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Once installed, see available commands below

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
